/* So I was confused with the given specification as to what the following table was meant to represent.
I assume here that it refers to specific physical habitats in which animals are shown/live and
which are cared for by (apparently) a single keeper. To this end, I added habitat_id as primary key
and use the keeper's id as foreign key relating this physical habitat to a keeper employee...
This is all very much subject to change and discussion!*/
