  "readme": "## Cover - Native JavaScript Code Coverage\n\nCover gives you the ability to collect code-coverage for your projects, using\nwhatever unit test framework you want, and all using native JavaScript. It also\ncomes bundled with pre-defined reporters, such as HTML and CLI output, so you\ncan easily see where you are missing coverage.\n\n### Standing on the shoulders of giants\n\nI would be amiss to not mention that the hard work in this library was\nby [Chris Dickinson] with his work on [runforcover]. In reality, Cover is \na fork of runforcover, fixing some of the issues and making it more usable.\n\nThe original version of Cover used [substack]'s excellent [bunker] library,\nbut it has recently been moved to using [esprima] and a new code homegrown\ninstrumentation library.\n\n### Known Issues\n\nThere are currently a few known issues that I am working on:\n\n1. If you use 'global' to pass state between modules (mocha does this, for\nexample), then you might run into issues. Cover runs modules as if they\nwere executed with `NODE_MODULE_CONTEXTS` was set.\n\n2. If you start new node processes, Cover won't work with those, as\nit instruments by hooking into `require`.\n\n### Usage\n\nUsing Cover is simple. Simply install it globally:\n\n> npm install cover -g\n\nAnd then, run it\n\n> cover run mytests.js\n\nWant to pass some arguments to your test? No problem (note the `--`):\n\n> cover run mytests.js -- --arg1 --arg2=foo\n\n Once you've run your tests, it will create a directory with coverage data in it.\n If you want to see the coverage report, simply run:\n \n > cover report\n \n which will output the report to the CLI. Want to get an HTML report?\n \n > cover report html\n \n This will create a `cover_html` directory with the coverage information.\n \n### Configuration\n\nCover reads from a `.coverrc` file in your project directory, and it comes\nwith sensible defaults. Here are the defaults that it uses:\n\n    {\n        \"formatter\": \"cli\",\n        \"ignore\": \".coverignore\",\n        \n        \"prefix\": \"coveragefile_\",              // Prefix for coverage data files\n        \"dataDirectory\": \".coverage_data\",      // Directory to put coverage files in\n        \n        \"debugDirectory\": \".coverage_debug\",    // Directory to put instrumented files in\n        \n        \"modules\": false,                       // Whether or not to cover node_modules directory\n        \n        // Formatter-specific info\n        \"html\" : {\n            \"directory\": \"cover_html\",          // Directory to write HTML files too\n            \"generateIndex\": true               // Whether to generate an index.html file\n        },\n        \n        \"json\": {\n        }\n    }\n    \nYou can also specify which files to ignore using .coverignore. Here is the one used\nfor Cover itself:\n\n    node_modules\n    \nYou can specify both files and directories in the `.coverignore` file.\n\nIf you have a customer path for your configuration files, you can specify this\non the command line:\n\n> cover --config path/to/config --ignore path/to/ignore run myfile.js\n\n[esprima]: http://www.esprima.org\n[substack]: https://github.com/substack\n[bunker]: https://github.com/substack/node-bunker\n[Chris Dickinson]: https://github.com/chrisdickinson\n[runforcover]: https://github.com/chrisdickinson/node-runforcover",
