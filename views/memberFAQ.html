    <p id="A6" class="answer">Memberships are not transferable and in most cases no refund may be issued. It is assumed that every member will have visited often enough to recoup the cost (2-3 visits) regardless of how recently the membership was purchased.</p>
    <br>

    <a id="Q7" class="question" href="javascript:toggle2('A7','Q7');" >CAN I CHANGE THE NAME ON MY MEMBERSHIP CARD?</a>

    <br>

    <a id="Q9" class="question" href="javascript:toggle2('A9','Q9');" >WHY MUST EVERYONE BE LISTED ON THE MEMBERSHIP CARD?</a>
    <p id="A9" class="answer">Each membership is designed for a specific set of individuals, not an open-ended admission card. By naming each member we are better able to protect the integrity of the membership program and offer more benefits to our participating members.</p>
